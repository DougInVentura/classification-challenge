### Description

In this assigment, we are working with data from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). We are tasked with improving the email filtering system for it's customers. This involves training two classification models to predict which emails are spam and which are not spam. The two models are logistic regression and the ensemble method, Random Forest.  The data will be slit into train and test. The data is labeled, with the 'y' variable called 'spam' in the dataset with it taking on values of zero (not spam) or one (spam).  The accuracy scores for both methods were calculated. The Random Forest method provided the higher overall accuracy, with a score of 95.8% on the test group. the Logistic Regression model had an accuarcy of 92.3%.
